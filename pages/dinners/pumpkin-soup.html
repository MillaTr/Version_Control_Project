<header><h1>PUMPKIN SOUP</h1></header>
<ul><li>6 servings</li></ul>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
		<li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
		<li>1kg pumpkin or squash (try kabocha), peeled, deseeded and chopped into chunks</li>
		<li>700ml vegetable stock or chicken stock</li>
		<li>150ml double cream</li>
		<li>handful pumpkin seeds</li>		
	</ul>
   <h2>For the croutons:</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
	    <li>4 slices wholemeal seeded bread, crusts removed</li>    
	</ul>
	<h2>Instructions:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan, then gently cook 2 finely chopped onions for 5 mins, until soft but not coloured.</li>
		<li>Add 1kg pumpkin or squash, cut into chunks, to the pan, then carry on cooking for 8-10 mins, stirring occasionally until it starts to soften and turn golden.</li>
		<li>Pour 700ml vegetable or chicken stock into the pan and season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 mins until the squash is very soft.</li>
		<li>Pour 150ml double cream into the pan, bring back to the boil, then pur√©e with a hand blender. For an extra-velvety consistency you can pour the soup through a fine sieve. The soup can now be frozen for up to 2 months.</li>  
		<li>To make the croutons: cut 4 slices wholemeal seeded bread into small squares.</li>
		<li>Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan, then fry the bread until it starts to become crisp.</li>
		<li>Add a handful of pumpkin seeds to the pan, then cook for a few mins more until they are toasted. These can be made a day ahead and stored in an airtight container.</li>
		<li>Reheat the soup if needed, taste for seasoning, then serve scattered with croutons and seeds and drizzled with more olive oil, if you want.</li>
